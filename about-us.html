            <h1>Explaining a Software Developer. What does a Software Developer do?</h1>
           <p>"A job description for a software developer includes researching, designing, building, and managing computer and application software. They apply scientific and technological principles to user needs, write code, and ensure software functionality. These developers must know coding languages, have problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, and understand the software development process.

Software developers collaborate with coders, computer programmers, software engineers, and other team members or work independently through the development process. They test software, make changes as needed, and document their efforts.

Application software developers create mobile and desktop applications, while systems software engineers focus on operating systems. Game software developers, security software developers, database developers, and web developers are among the other specializations in the field."
